Example cron entry.

*/5 * * * * /home/www-data/dudi.sh >/dev/null 2>&1


Okay, the above entry makes some assumptions:
1) That your web server process is owned by the 'www-data' user
2) That you have read previous documentation and used a temp directory.
3) That you want to run this script ever five minutes.


Feel free to adjust as needed.
